The Google Play Store Apps Project analyzes a dataset of Android applications to uncover trends and insights for app developers. The dataset includes app categories, ratings, reviews, installs, sizes, and prices. Key tasks include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and removing duplicates. Through exploratory data analysis and visualizations, the project identifies popular categories like "Games" and "Family" with the highest installs, while "Events" and "Education" have the best average ratings. Relationships between app size, price, and popularity are also explored. This analysis provides actionable insights to help developers optimize their apps and meet market demands.
